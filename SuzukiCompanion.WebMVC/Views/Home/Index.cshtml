            <p>
                The Suzuki Companion gives you a powerful tool to supplement inbetween private lessons. <br />
                The Suzuki Method relies so heavily on parent involvement. <br />
                As the modern day evolves and most households have two-incomes, the support needed from <br />
                parents is often times, too much. As private teachers ourselves, <br />
                We see the strain the method can sometimes puts on parents in order to be successful. <br />
                So we had been creating content to help make your part a bit easier. <br />
                So, we built this app with you and your children's success in mind. We are here to support you. <br />
